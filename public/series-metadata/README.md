# Series Metadata

This directory stores the final UI-ready metadata JSON files consumed by the frontend.

## Purpose

These files provide structured data about film series (title, description, films, showtimes, etc.) for the FilmForum application. They are validated at build time to ensure data integrity.

## How Files Get Here

Generated by the metadata script:
```bash
node scripts/generate-series-metadata.js <series-slug>
```

This script processes parsed HTML data from `data/parsed/<series-slug>.json` and outputs structured JSON files here.

## Naming Convention

Each file is named by series slug: `{series-slug}.json`

Example: `tenement-stories.json`, `noir-city.json`

## Validation

Files are validated at build time by `src/config/seriesMetadata.ts`, which ensures all required fields are present and correctly formatted.
