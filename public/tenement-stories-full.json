The impressible Mrs. Scorsese (who later got a SAG card after popping up frequently in her son’s films—most memorably as Joe Pesci’s mother in GOODFELLAS) shows off snapshots from a recent trip to Italy (mostly of family dinners), argues with her husband about home wine-making techniques, and interrupts her son repeatedly to nurse her later-anthologized spaghetti sauce, revealed at breakneck speed in the end credits. Scorsese purposely left the hyphen out of the title, explaining that his parents “are neither Italian nor American. They are one.”",

Abraham, the pious father learned in religion but uninterested in business, has difficulty making a living and adjusting to life in America. The daughter Sara scrubs floors in the tenement in order to earn money and ‘become a somebody.’ The mother Hannah, a noble matriarch, scrimps and saves to paint her dingy kitchen white only to have her landlord raise the rent because of the improvements. This early silent film was produced in a Hollywood studio but the street scenes were shot on location on the Lower East Side in New York City.

As captured in the grimy expressionist grain of Sean Price Williams’s claustrophobic camera work, FROWNLAND is DIY cinema at its most fearless, uncompromising, and unforgettable.\n\n35mm print courtesy Ronald Bronstein.",

The impressible Mrs. Scorsese (who later got a SAG card after popping up frequently in her son’s films—most memorably as Joe Pesci’s mother in GOODFELLAS) shows off snapshots from a recent trip to Italy (mostly of family dinners), argues with her husband about home wine-making techniques, and interrupts her son repeatedly to nurse her later-anthologized spaghetti sauce, revealed at breakneck speed in the end credits. Scorsese purposely left the hyphen out of the title, explaining that his parents “are neither Italian nor American. They are one.”",

Think he’ll get the African-American tenants to move out? Think he can even get them to start paying rent? And bring back those hubcaps! First feature by Hal Ashby (HAROLD AND MAUDE, SHAMPOO, BEING THERE, COMING HOME) is both a time capsule of ’70s cinema—direct-to-the-camera dialogue, jagged editing, jarring bursts of music on the soundtrack, echoey on-location sound...and those bellbottoms!—as well as an edgy (before the term was coined), rope-dancing-on-the-razor’s-edge dramedy on race in America, with Bridges’ mom, Oscar®-nominated Lee Grant, taking a break from nurse-maiding the Spinal Meningitis Ball to get down on a pot likker with Pearl Bailey; Diana Sands’ painfully making a shocking admission to “Sioux Indian” hubbie Lou Gossett; Robert Klein’s turn in blackface; and the ‘N’ word, but not said by whom, and to whom, you might think. With camera work by the great Gordon Willis (KLUTE, ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN, ANNIE HALL, and all three GODFATHERS); screenplay by Black actor/writer Bill Gunn (GANJA AND HESS); and as the good-natured jerk rich boy (“I’m a bastard”), a could-pass-for-18 Beau Bridges, who surprisingly was 29 at the time.",

Think he’ll get the African-American tenants to move out? Think he can even get them to start paying rent? And bring back those hubcaps! First feature by Hal Ashby (HAROLD AND MAUDE, SHAMPOO, BEING THERE, COMING HOME) is both a time capsule of ’70s cinema—direct-to-the-camera dialogue, jagged editing, jarring bursts of music on the soundtrack, echoey on-location sound...and those bellbottoms!—as well as an edgy (before the term was coined), rope-dancing-on-the-razor’s-edge dramedy on race in America, with Bridges’ mom, Oscar®-nominated Lee Grant, taking a break from nurse-maiding the Spinal Meningitis Ball to get down on a pot likker with Pearl Bailey; Diana Sands’ painfully making a shocking admission to “Sioux Indian” hubbie Lou Gossett; Robert Klein’s turn in blackface; and the ‘N’ word, but not said by whom, and to whom, you might think. With camera work by the great Gordon Willis (KLUTE, ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN, ANNIE HALL, and all three GODFATHERS); screenplay by Black actor/writer Bill Gunn (GANJA AND HESS); and as the good-natured jerk rich boy (“I’m a bastard”), a could-pass-for-18 Beau Bridges, who surprisingly was 29 at the time.",

A master in the harsh new American system, with its fourteen-hour workday, Moses attempts to reconstruct the lost harmony of the shtetl community in the paternalistic order of his sweatshop. He uses his wealth to show off and leaves the daily operations to his nephew Sam. When Masha Melnick pleads with him for her father's job, Moses, taken with the girl, rehires him. Masha also happens to be the sweetheart of Charlie, a labor activist who is trying to organize a union in Moses’ factory. Moses begins to court Masha who agrees to marry him in order to improve her family’s desperate financial position. She bears his child but confesses she feels wretched because she did not listen to her heart and marry Charlie who incites the workers to strike. The first Yiddish talkie engaged directly in the progressive currents of the day, political and aesthetic.” – Notes from The National Centre for Jewish Film\n\n16mm print courtesy The National Center for Jewish Film.",

    "runtime": "110 min",
    "description": "“You know what NAACP means, don’t you?” Whiter than white, richer then rich, callower than callow (“I’m 29!”) Beau Bridges tells the camera, on the impeccable lawn of his family compound as the Black butler delivers him a drink, that he needs a home of his own—except his dream house is a tenement in the way-before-gentrification Park Slope! Think he’ll get the African-American tenants to move out? Think he can even get them to start paying rent? And bring back those hubcaps! First feature by Hal Ashby (HAROLD AND MAUDE, SHAMPOO, BEING THERE, COMING HOME) is both a time capsule of ’70s cinema—direct-to-the-camera dialogue, jagged editing, jarring bursts of music on the soundtrack, echoey on-location sound...and those bellbottoms!—as well as an edgy (before the term was coined), rope-dancing-on-the-razor’s-edge dramedy on race in America, with Bridges’ mom, Oscar®-nominated Lee Grant, taking a break from nurse-maiding the Spinal Meningitis Ball to get down on a pot likker with Pearl Bailey; Diana Sands’ painfully making a shocking admission to “Sioux Indian” hubbie Lou Gossett; Robert Klein’s turn in blackface; and the ‘N’ word, but not said by whom, and to whom, you might think. With camera work by the great Gordon Willis (KLUTE, ALL THE PRESIDENT’S MEN, ANNIE HALL, and all three GODFATHERS); screenplay by Black actor/writer Bill Gunn (GANJA AND HESS); and as the good-natured jerk rich boy (“I’m a bastard”), a could-pass-for-18 Beau Bridges, who surprisingly was 29 at the time.",
