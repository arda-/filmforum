# Project Notes

## How to Work
- Know the basic documentation of tools being used (Astro, pnpm, etc.)
- Never hedge with "or whatever" - be precise
- If unsure, check the config/docs first
- If still unsure after checking, ask the user to help learn
- Don't guess or be vague about things that can be verified

## Package Manager
Use `pnpm` (not npm) for all package management commands.

## Demo Pages
Demo/test pages live at `/demo/*` with an index at `/demo`.
