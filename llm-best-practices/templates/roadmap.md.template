# [PROJECT_NAME] Roadmap

## Overview

**Duration:** [TOTAL_DURATION]
**Target:** [TARGET_DESCRIPTION]

**Key Milestones:**
- [MILESTONE_DATE_1]: [PHASE_NAME_1] complete
- [MILESTONE_DATE_2]: [PHASE_NAME_2] complete
- [MILESTONE_DATE_3]: [PHASE_NAME_3] complete

---

## Phases

### Phase 1: [PHASE_NAME_1] ([DURATION_1])

**Goal:** [PHASE_GOAL_1]

**Domains:**
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_1] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_2] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_3] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]

**Deliverable:** [PHASE_DELIVERABLE]
**Dependencies:** None (first phase)

---

### Phase 2: [PHASE_NAME_2] ([DURATION_2])

**Goal:** [PHASE_GOAL_2]

**Domains:**
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_1] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_2] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]

**Deliverable:** [PHASE_DELIVERABLE]
**Dependencies:** Requires Phase 1 complete

---

### Phase 3: [PHASE_NAME_3] ([DURATION_3])

**Goal:** [PHASE_GOAL_3]

**Domains:**
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_1] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]
- [PHASE_PREFIX]-[DOMAIN_2] — [DOMAIN_DESCRIPTION]

**Deliverable:** [PHASE_DELIVERABLE]
**Dependencies:** Requires Phase [N] complete

---

## Parallel Development Strategy

### Critical Path

```
Phase 1 ([DURATION_1])
    ↓
Phase 2 ([DURATION_2])
    ↓
Phase 3 ([DURATION_3])
```

### Parallelization Within Phases

Domains within a phase can often run in parallel. Use Phase.Domain.Step naming to track:

```
[PHASE_PREFIX].[DOMAIN].[STEP]

Example:
  1-foundation.1-schema.1-tables     (sequential within domain)
  1-foundation.2-api.1-endpoints     (parallel with schema domain)
  1-foundation.3-ui.1-components     (parallel with both above)
```

### Agent Allocation

When using parallel agents, distribute by domain:

- **Agent 1:** [DOMAIN_1] — [DESCRIPTION]
- **Agent 2:** [DOMAIN_2] — [DESCRIPTION]
- **Agent 3:** [DOMAIN_3] — [DESCRIPTION]

Stay within your memory budget (see sops/sop-agent-limits.md).

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1
- [ ] [METRIC_1]
- [ ] [METRIC_2]
- [ ] [METRIC_3]

### Phase 2
- [ ] [METRIC_1]
- [ ] [METRIC_2]

### Phase 3
- [ ] [METRIC_1]
- [ ] [METRIC_2]

---

## Risk Management

### [RISK_CATEGORY_1]
- **Risk:** [RISK_DESCRIPTION]
  - **Mitigation:** [MITIGATION_STRATEGY]

### [RISK_CATEGORY_2]
- **Risk:** [RISK_DESCRIPTION]
  - **Mitigation:** [MITIGATION_STRATEGY]

---

## Resource Planning

### Team Size
- **Optimal:** [N] developers
- **With AI assistance:** [SPEEDUP_ESTIMATE] faster, up to [N] parallel agents

### Tool Requirements
- Source control (Git)
- [BUILD_TOOL]
- [DATABASE]
- [CI_CD]

---

## How to Adapt This Roadmap

1. **Change phases** — Replace with your product phases
2. **Change domains** — Match your system architecture
3. **Change timelines** — Adjust based on team size
4. **Change deliverables** — Define what "done" means for each phase
5. **Change metrics** — Use your own success criteria

---

## Using This Roadmap with LLM Agents

### For Planning
```
"Create implementation plan for Phase [N] using Phase.Domain.Step structure.
Identify parallel work streams and dependencies."
```

### For Execution
```
"Launch agents for:
- Agent 1: [PHASE].[DOMAIN_1].[STEP]
- Agent 2: [PHASE].[DOMAIN_2].[STEP]"
```

### For Tracking
Mark items as:
- Completed
- In progress
- Planned
- Blocked (with dependency reference)
