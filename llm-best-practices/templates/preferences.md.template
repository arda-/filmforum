# User Preferences & Workflow Patterns

This file contains user-specific preferences for how Claude Code should work in this repository.

## Communication Style Preferences

- **Concise updates**: Brief status updates, no verbose explanations unless asked
- **Parallel execution**: When multiple tasks can run in parallel, launch them all at once
- **Background agents**: Use background agents liberally for independent work
- **No time estimates**: Don't provide time estimates for tasks

## Agent Concurrency & Memory Limits

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- **Maximum [N] concurrent agents** at any time
- **Total memory limit**: [Your limit] GB
- **Per-agent memory**: ~4.4GB (observed max)

### Decision Tree: When to Use Agents

1. **Can I do this directly?** (without agents)
   - Simple file edits → Use Read/Edit/Write
   - Single component → Do it directly

2. **How many concurrent agents will I spawn?**
   - 1-2 tasks → Do it directly (no agents)
   - 3-5 tasks → 1-to-1 (3-5 agents, one per task)
   - 6-8 tasks → Mostly parallel (6-7 agents, start batching around 7)
   - 9+ tasks → Batch strategically (5-8 agents)
   - Never exceed [N] concurrent

## Code Review Standards

**Tone:** Professional, factual, engineer-to-engineer.

**Avoid:**
- Excessive praise ("excellent!", "amazing!", star ratings)
- Flowery language ("comprehensive", "thorough" overuse)
- Emoji overload
- Overly structured sections

**Include:**
- What changed (factual list with line counts)
- Issues found (specific line refs, severity: blocking/non-blocking)
- Test results (numbers, pass/fail)
- Recommendation (merge/needs-work/block + rationale)

**Good Example:**
```markdown
## Changes

- Added 126 unit tests for [component]
- Fixed [issue] in [files]
- Made [improvement]

## Issues

None. All tests pass, build succeeds.

## Recommendation

Merge. Zero breaking changes, test coverage improved [X]%.
```

## AI-Generated Content Disclaimers

**IMPORTANT**: All AI-generated content (PR descriptions, code reviews, comments) must include a disclaimer.

### Required Format

At the bottom of all AI-generated content, add:

```

```

**Format**: `🤖 Written by Claude Sonnet 4.5 ([model-id]) at [ISO-8601-timestamp]`

### When to Include

- ✅ PR titles and descriptions
