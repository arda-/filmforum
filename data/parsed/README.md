# parsed

This directory stores JSON output from the HTML parser.

## Why it exists

- Acts as the intermediate step between raw HTML and final UI metadata
- Preserves all extracted content before the generator selects/transforms specific fields
- Allows the site generator to run independently from the parsing step
- Makes it easy to inspect what data was successfully extracted

## How files get here

Files are generated by the parser script:

```bash
scripts/parse-series-html.js
```

This script reads HTML from `data/raw-html/`, extracts structured data, and outputs JSON files here. Each JSON file corresponds to a film series page.
